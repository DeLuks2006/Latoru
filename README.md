<h1 align=center>Latoru</h1>
<p align=center>Latoru is a tool that helps Russian learners type Russian using the Latin alphabet while the program replaces it with Cyrillic characters.</p>

## How it Works

We set a low level hook on the keyboard, and evaluate which buttons were 
pressed. If combinations such as "ye", "yu", "yo", "ya" were pressed, 
we use the "y" as a modifier and send out the correct character.
